# BLEServer

Communication between two ESP32 via Bluetooth making use of the BLEServer library.

I used UUID characteristics to send and receive data.

The server side reads and process potentiometer data and sends it to the client side throughout Bluetooth Low Energy.

The client side turns on a led with PWM with the data obtained from the server side.
